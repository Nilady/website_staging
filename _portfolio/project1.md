At Redhill Games, I led, coached, and mentored a team of nine game designers and UX designers. I helped them shape their careers, take ownership of their growth, and navigate both everyday challenges as well as broader team dynamics.

To support them, I worked closely with the team while also collaborating with clients. This allowed me to refine internal processes and improve communication to ensure a more effective and supportive work environment.
