Designing UX for tools is very different from designing UX for games.

<h3>Frozenbyte's Proprietary Engine</h3>
Frozenbyte has a proprietary engine that's been growing with the company since its early days. Over the years and with new game projects new features have been added as the need has arisen.

The engine has been used to create games on multiple different platforms: PC, consoles (multiple generations of XBox, PlayStation, and Nintendo), and mobile.

<h3>My Role</h3>
I was hired to own and improve the UX of the engine as well as any other tools used in the company. I had a background of UX research and design as well as programming, so could do this task independently. As I was coming in new, I hadn't yet ran into any issues with the or created workarounds for them. I also had a background in creating tools, albeit outside of games, so I understood what the design goals for tools are. Namely: Efficiency is more important than fun, and challenge is not what users were looking for.

<h3>Understanding User Needs</h3>
My approach to understanding user needs was three-tiered:
* I learned to use the engine through tutorials created in-house to understand the starting point
* I learned to use competing game engines as well as other 3D editing software to understand the conventions in the space
* I conducted user research to understand users and their needs better through interviews, shadowing, and combing through internal wiki for various wishlists people had written on their own spaces, or shared spaces.

<h4>Learning Frozenbyte's Engine</h4>
Frozenbyte had created very robust gamified tutorials for all new recruits to understand how the engine works in the context of the game people were working on. It covered the basics from all forms of design and art, but left out everything that happened outside of the engine itself, including programming and third party software.

<h4>Learning Other Engines</h4>
I completed various tutorials of a handful of other engines, including, but not limited to Unreal Engine 4, Unity, CryEngine, and GameMaker: Studio.

I also reacquainted myself with or learned other 3D editing software, such as Blender, Autodesk Maya, and ZBrush.

This allowed me to understand better what were the conventions in the space and what kind of best practices already existed in other software. I could also compare Frozenbyte's engine against them.

<h4>User Research at Frozenbyte</h4>
At the time Frozenbyte worked on four different projects, each at different stages of development.

* One had just been released and updates and DLC were in the works.
* One was approaching polish phase
* Two were in the iteration phase of development

I reached out to people in different teams from different disciplines to understand how and why they used the engine and what their pain points were.

This was done through shadowing, interviews, and reading the internal wiki and backlog of issues.

<b>Shadowing</b> means simply that they did their work and I watched. I explained this beforehand, so people usually either didn't really prepare and did their business as usual, or planned to show some very common workflows of theirs, especially if there were issues.

In the latter case people would explain what they were doing more readily, while people in the former group would often work quietly until I had a question.

<b>Interviews</b> were conducted either in conjunction with the shadowing or separately. Basically, the idea was to better understand the context in which the engine was used. People would explain their workdays, approaches, etc. on a higher level, so I could understand better when and how the engine and other tools were used, what kind of communication was needed around their use, etc.

<b>Internal wiki</b> aimed to document everything. Projects, tools, events, etc. Additionally, every employee had their own workspace in the wiki to store and share their thoughts with others easily.

The tools were, of course, documented at some point in time in the wiki. Some documentations were more up to date than others, mostly depending on how many people would need to be onboarded to use the tools at any given time. Some tool pages contained a "known issues" or "suggestions" list.

Many people had written down their own gripes and workarounds to different tools in their own workspaces.

Combing through these and putting them all together was a fun task akin to archaeology or detective work.

Of course there was already a <b>backlog</b> of issues. However it hadn't been prioritised or kept very much up to date, so there were tasks that had accumulated over years. There were many duplicates and similar tasks, and many tasks had been fixed or become obsolete.

<h3>Owning the Development of All Tools</h3>
After collecting a lot of data from my own experience learning the tools, getting familiar with other tools, talking and observing people actually using the tools, and looking at historical efforts and ideas, I updated the backlog and built a roadmap.

I was lucky, as this was a new position, there was time to focus purely on gathering and organising information. I could have jumped faster into implementing changes, but this gave me a chance to build a very comprehensive picture of the landscape and the needs.


<h3>Impact</h3>
Turns out that <i>just having a dedicated person interested in issues with the tools improved morale in the studio</i>.

Previously, people would get frustrated alone or maybe talk to their closest colleagues to find a workaround. Once people understood there was a person actively improving the tools, they were happy to share all the issues they had with them, but not at all bothered by the fact that their frustrations wouldn't be fixed immediately.

<i>Just feeling seen and heard made people feel much happier with their situation.</I>

Within months of me starting my work, there was quite a bit of interest in the company in my work. Many programmers volunteered to help with the tools in quiet moments. Soon enough, I was leading an unofficial team of four, most of whom worked on the project part-time.

Some members of this new team wanted to make a completely new version of the engine and other tools. A chance came when a game project needed in-game editor spaces for customisation. Our team was charged with handling those, and the team grew to four programmers and two designers.

Most of the team worked on the new in-game editors that paved the way for the new editor. The most senior programmers focused on incoming and acute requests for the existing editor. I kept both sub teams on track and was the point of contact for all engine/tools related communication.



* Frozenbyte has their own engine that's been added to over the years starting from its earliest games
* multi-platform game engine
* I was hired to enhance its UX thanks to my background in programming and UX design
* Learned the tool, learned competitors, conducted user research: interviews, shadowing, combed internal documentation for wish lists (of which there were many) - different disciplines, different game teams
* Created and owned the roadmap of the engine
* Over time gathered interest from the rest of the company and over time built a tools team consisting of 4 programmers and 2 designers
* Game engine and editor, in-game editors, other tools
