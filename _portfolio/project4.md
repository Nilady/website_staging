When I first joined a game project at Frozenbyte, I was asked to quickly check the menus and their navigation before they were implemented. Timeline for this entire process (check and implementation) was one month. In reality it took over 6 months to finalise the menus.

When the team shifted to the next project, the UI artist and I decided to ensure the UI pipeline was much more efficient in this and future projects.

The main issue was, each menu screen was treated as an individual feature with multiple programmers working on different ones at the same time. This lead to multiple implementations of the same functionality, many extra rounds of iteration per menu, and small visual issues, such as over 20 different shades of yellow used for highlights across all menus.

To avoid this we created a style guide. It would help the design and art teams to stay on top of all assets, and guide programmers in implementation by describing the way different UI elements function in different situations. We opted to not build a full design system, as the point was to lessen the workload on programmers and we didnâ€™t have their full buy-in for this project at the start.

This helped streamline the UI design and creation process significantly, by improving communication and shared understanding. This also had the added benefit of improving the accessibility of our games as the UI was more accessible by default as the accessibility features needed to be defined only once for each UI element.

Through this and prototyping efforts introduced in Trine 4 <link> the UI creation process was reduced by more than half from approximately 36 man months for Nine Parchments to around 16 man months for Trine 4.
