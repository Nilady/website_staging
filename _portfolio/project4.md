For Trine 5 I led the design and planning of the user research efforts, ensuring smooth collaboration between the development and research teams. I created timelines, templates, and processes to streamline communication and make user research rounds as efficient and impactful as possible.

I also conducted multiple rounds of expert analysis on the prototype and helped the game design team to identify and address issues before testing with external players.
