As the UX Lead I set up the UI pipeline and process for this game, and large at the entire company at Frozenbyte. I introduced style guides and prototypes that dramatically cut down on implementation time. By shifting iteration to the design phase with these systems, I improved efficiency and streamlined communication during handoff.

To further enhance the UX and game design efforts, I introduced expert analysis reviews, I or other senior designers outside the design team evaluated prototypes to identify usability issues before user testing. This ensured testing focused on uncovering novel insights rather than known problems.

During these expert reviews I paid special attention to accessibility issues which hadn't been done before. This approach was very cost effective and efficient, led to the most accessible game in the series at that time, and paved the way for more thorough accessibility efforts in future projects.
