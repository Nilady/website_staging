  subtitle: I joined <i>Nine Parchments</i> just before launch to optimize menu functionality for multiple input devices across PC, consoles, and the Nintendo Switch. Working closely with the UI artist, we redesigned complex menus, focusing on usability and consistency, ultimately refining the UI pipeline in the company.

I joined this project a month before planned launch date. My task was to go over the menu functionality, information architecture, and navigation to ensure the game could be played comfortably with PC, consoles, and Nintendo Switchâ€™s handheld mode.

The UI artist had already designed and created high fidelity mockups for the menus, but they had done so with only mouse navigation in mind.

I redesigned the menus with the support of the UI artist to accommodate multiple different input devices: mouse only, keyboard only, mouse and keyboard, controllers, and touch. This required minor tweaks in some menus, but some required a complete overhaul of the interaction design and information architecture of the original design.

The redesign addressed the need for multi-input device compatibility allowing us to ship the game on all the target platforms. It also enhanced the player experience by ensuring consistency and ease of use across all platforms.

Ultimately, the game was launched 4 months after I joined, due to outside forces. Thanks to the complexity of the menus and a lack of proper UI pipeline, he redesign and implementation of the menus lasted altogether around 6 months, well past the initial launch, to the launch of the DLC. During this time, I owned menu design and implementation, creating and prioritising features and tasks, as well as ensured the consistency of menu implementation in terms of look and feel and functionality. This experience lead to me creating  a more defined UI pipeline at Frozenbyte during the development of Trine 4.
