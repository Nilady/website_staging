I joined this project a month before planned launch date. My task was to go over the menu functionality, information architecture, and navigation to ensure the game could be played comfortably with PC, consoles, and Nintendo Switchâ€™s handheld mode.

The UI artist had already designed and created high fidelity mockups for the menus, but they had done so with only mouse navigation in mind.

I redesigned the menus together with the UI artist to accommodate multiple different input devices: mouse only, keyboard only, mouse and keyboard, controllers, and touch. This required minor tweaks in some menus, but some required an overhaul of the interaction design and information architecture.

The redesign and implementation of the menus lasted around 6 months, well past the initial launch, to the launch of the DLC. During this time, I prioritised features and tasks and ensured the consistency of menu implementation in terms of look and feel as well as interaction. This experience lead to the creation of a more defined UI pipeline at Frozenbyte.
